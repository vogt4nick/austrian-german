# A Practical Guide to Dialect in the Linzer Raum

> _The dialect is here; we can't talk ourselves out of it now. It is spoken, and it is important that people simply be not afraid of the dialect, knowing that they will never have to speak dialect. Nobody expects that._[^interview]

I and my wife are English-speaking immigrants to Linz. We arrived on the tail of the pandemic and did our best to jump into local life: making friends, going to festivals like Frühschoppen and Maibaumaufstellen, and picking up key phrases like "i wüü bitte a Hoibe." Even now, years later, we've found it tough to understand the local dialect.

<!-- Purpose of the Book: Clearly articulate why you wrote the book and what you hope to achieve with it. Explain the problem it aims to solve or the insights it aims to provide. -->

Dialect is uniquely challenging. It is distinct from standard German. It is geographically diverse with no standard form. Learning the regional vocabulary and vowel shifts is fun and often funny, but Austrians do not merely spackle mad-libs within standard German grammar. There are tangible differences between standard German and the local dialect.

<!-- Overview of Content: Provide a concise overview of the main sections or chapters of the book. Highlight key themes, concepts, or stories that readers can look forward to exploring. -->

This is our practical guide to understanding dialect in the Linzer Raum. It explains dialect features, associates them with scenarios we encounter in real life, and provides practical exercises to evaluate what we've learned well and what we need to improve. The language emphasis is on contemporary speech we encounter in and around Linz. Regional vocabulary will consequently appear throughout, however definitions are not the focus of this guide ([there][wb1] [are][wb2] [enough][wb3] [regional][wb4] [dictionaries][wb5]). Finally, as dialect has no standard orthography, spelling reflects common usage by our friends and colleagues.

<!-- Challenges and Inspirations: Discuss any challenges you faced during the writing process and what inspired you to overcome them. This adds depth to your connection with the reader. -->

We believe understanding dialect is essential to integrate. Integration is not merely friends and festivals. It's the personal and societal chores we take for granted: appointments, taxes, and bureaucracy (so much bureaucracy), and it's the ugly things too: emergencies, xenophobia, crime, and even death. Life happens no matter where you live. Full integration requires grappling with the realities of life in a foreign country. In Austria, everyone understands standard German, but not everybody speaks standard German. Austrians speak dialect.

<!-- Gratitude: Acknowledge and express gratitude to anyone who supported or influenced you in the creation of the book. This could include mentors, family, friends, or colleagues. -->

We are fortunate to have friends we can rely on, who are always there in a moment of need. As instrumental as they've been to our integration, this guide would not be possible without our friends. In fact it cannot work without friends.

<!-- Encouragement: Offer words of encouragement to the reader. Explain how the book can benefit them and inspire them to dive into the content with enthusiasm. -->

This guide cannot work alone. It cannot replace immersion nor foundational German language skills. It cannot move the mountain. But we need not explore every single path to climb the mountain --- even Hagenbergers let out an audible _Hä?_ passing through Rohrbach. There will be multiple climbs and multiple paths, and even at the end we still will not know every inch of it. This dialect is our Hausberg. The more we understand, the more connected we'll feel to our home and host country.
